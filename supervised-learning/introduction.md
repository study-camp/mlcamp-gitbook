# Introduction

This section covers the "Supervised Learning" segment of the [Machine Learning - UD262 course.](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)

Supervised learning:

In Machine learning, supervised learning is a type of ML where the system was given with labeled examples. The labeled examples are nothing but the information related to the training datasetsmodels. For ex, if you would like the system to predict the face of a dog or a fox. You would feed the system with the sample dog and fox faces etc.

# Machine Learning Study Camp 2017

## About Study Camp

The idea behind Study Camp is to combine the self-study approach of online learning with the support system provided by a study group that is focused on the same topic. In particular, a "Study Camp" typically has three components:

* _Professional Content_: We look for industry or expert authored content on a topic, ensuring that it is up-to-date with current technology advancements and likely to have less inaccuracies or omissions that can hinder learning.
* _Scouts & Trails_: Because there are so many sources and types of content, a key value of study camps is to provide a curated set of resources and a clear trail to follow for all campers regardless of their expertise. This allows beginners to acquire basic knowledge before tackling tougher topics, while advanced campers can progress directly to more difficult trails. In addition, we identify "Trail Scouts", campers who either have experience with a specific trail or have simply progressed ahead on a new trail so that they can return and report any issues/challenges to help others navigate that terrain.
* _Communication Channels_: A key goal for study camps was to allow everyone in the community to participate regardless of where they live, when they can participate, and how much experience they have on the topic. To achieve this we employ **Slack** as our communications channel. All campers are expected \(mandatory\) to join the Slack channel and participate at least once a week \(in a regular _check in_\) to provide updates about their progress. A failure to check in four consecutive times will automatically remove that camper from that specific camp expedition.

## About Machine Learning Study Camps

Machine learning is eating the world, with technology companies and products increasingly moving from a _mobile first_ mentaluty to an _AI First_ mentality where machines can now support, enhance or automate many tasks that were previously considered the realm of human computation. Huge advances in sensing, computer vision and natural language processing mean that computers can not only "see", "hear", "speak" and "touch" like humans -- but they can better understand what they see/hear and take relevant decisions in context.

What does this mean for the regular user?

It means that regardless of your expertise or domain, you will encounter machine learning tools, technologies, use cases and solutions in your daily life. And it is therefore important to have familiarity with the _terminology_, understand the _concepts_ behind it, and learn the _algorithms & tools_ available to employ or implement many of those ideas into your own products or applications.

With Machine Learning Camp \(MLCAMP\), the goal is to follow a slow and progressive approach to machine learning:

* Phase 1: Python Fundamentals
* Phase 2: Data Analysis
* Phase 3: Machine Learning
* Phase 4: Deep Learning
* Phase 5: Specialization \(AI, Robotics, Self-Driving Cars, etc.\)

## About MLCamp Trails

Over time, we will be updating this section with the relevant trails \(syllabus\) for each phase. A lot of these recommendations are based on the guidance provided for [**Preliminary Resources for the Udacity MLND.**](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/nd009?nocache#!#preliminary-resources)

These topics reflect the pre-requisites outline in the [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). We will try to cover these in full though we may not necessarily do those in the same order.

It is our hope that some subset of Study Campers will consider following through and enrolling in that program to complete projects and obtain their certification in due course. However, that is a paid program. Our focus on Study Camp is leverage freely available resources first to ensure that all campers get foundational understanding of the concepts before they enroll in any paid program.

### PYTHON TRAIL

Most of the intermediate and advanced tools and techniques for machine learning \(that we will cover\) require knowledge of Python \(the programming language\). In particular, we expect that students will need a primer in the following aspects of Python that we hope to cover in these notes.

1. _Strings, numbers, and variables_
2. _Statements, operators, and expressions_
3. _Lists, tuples, and dictionaries_
4. _Conditions, loops_
5. _Procedures, objects, modules, and libraries_
6. _Troubleshooting and debugging_
7. _Research & Documentation_
8. _Problem solving_
9. _Algorithms and data structures_

**RESOURCES:**

1. [LearnPython.org \(Online\)](https://www.gitbook.com/book/study-camp/ml-camp-2017/edit#) - great interactive tutorial for data science, supported by DataCamp
